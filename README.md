# Flight-Fare-Prediction
Aim: To build a machine learning model which would predict the prices of the flight using various features like sourse, destination, stops, arrival time, departure time etc.
The data set used for prediction is the data of flight prices for various flights between the months of march and june 2019. For dataset please visit https://www.kaggle.com/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh/. 
Project is mainly divided into four parts:
# 1.EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis)
# 2.Feature Engineering
# 3.Feature Selection
# 4.Model Selection(I have used random forest regression model on the train set)
